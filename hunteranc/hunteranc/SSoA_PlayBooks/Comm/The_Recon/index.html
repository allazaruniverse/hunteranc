        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Intimidator is the <strong>muscle</strong> & the <strong>enforcer</strong> using their <strong>strength</strong>, and and <strong>charisma</strong> to dominate others and control the battlefield. 
            They aren’t just about brute force—they know how to use their presence and fearsome reputation to manipulate situations, coerce others into submission, and get the job done.
            Whether it’s making an enemy cower in fear or persuading someone to give up vital information, the Intimidator gets results through a blend of charisma and raw power.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think of The Intimidator as a character who can crush skulls with their fists but also intimidate a room full of enemies into submission without breaking a sweat. 
            They are the heavy hitter both physically and socially.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Intimidator excels at <strong>controlling situations</strong> through fear, force, and sheer presence. 
            Whether it’s <strong>breaking bones</strong>or <strong>breaking spirits</strong>, they ensure that their team always has the upper hand. 
            They are the first to step up when a show of strength is needed and the one everyone looks to when negotiations take a hard turn. 
            Their <strong>brutal charisma</strong> makes them both a social and physical powerhouse, capable of leading through intimidation and crushing opposition through raw strength.

                    <p>Unlike the Eyes in the Sky, your drones aren’t about precision—<strong>they’re about pressure</strong>. You have a special set of combat drones designed to <strong>overwhelm, crush, and instill fear</strong>. Choose two (2) drones to deploy during a <strong>single hunt:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Execution (Heavy Assault Drone)</strong> A walking gun platform with <strong>a high-powered shotgun or rotary cannon</strong> (depending on the one you purchase). It <strong>suppresses enemy positions</strong> and makes them think twice before peeking out.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Hound (Tracker Drone)</strong> This drone <strong>hunts a target relentlessly</strong>, emitting a deep, unnerving mechanical growl. Targets pursued by the Hound suffer <strong> disadvantage on stealth and escape attempts</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Sweep (Shockwave Drone): Deploys with a loud, concussive blast</strong>, throwing enemies off balance and knocking weaker ones off their feet. Breaks defensive lines with ease.</li>
                        <li><strong>Get Over Here (Restraint Drone):</strong>  a counter-capture drone that launches out mechanical tendrils to <strong>bind, choke, or pin a target in place</strong>. Can be used to take someone <strong>alive</strong> or <strong>to crush them into unconsciousness</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ruckus (Terror Swarm): </strong>Releases a <strong>cloud of micro-drones</strong> that create intense noise, flashing lights, and eerie distorted voices - disorienting enemies and making them <strong> easier to inimidate or control</strong>.</li>
                    </ul></strong>
                    <p><strong>Once per hunt,</strong> you can use a <STRONG>JUICE</STRONG> point and <strong>unleash both of your drones in a terrifying full-force asssault,</strong> overwhelming an area.

                    <p>Your Membrane Map doesn’t just track the Hunt—it <strong>projects your presence into the minds of those caught within it.</strong> Through a combination of biometric scans, behavioral prediction, and psychological warfare, you can make enemies <strong>feel</strong> like they’re already cornered.</p>

                        <li><strong>7-9</strong></strong> you get <strong>two advantages</strong>, but your intense projection draws attention—<strong>an enemy resists harder or focuses on you in panic-fueled desperation.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>6 or less</strong> the system<strong> overloads, glitches, or backfires</strong>, making your allies momentarily uneasy or giving false information.</li>
